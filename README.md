### Picker 3D Clone

This project is a clone of the game Picker 3D. There were two points that I focused on while doing this project, one of them was that the **Game feeling** should be like in the original game. it should make the user feel the feeling of collecting the ball. The other thing I focused on was that the **Project Code Structure** should have clean code and be modular. That's why I stick to OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and EDP (Event Driven Programming) while developing my project. In this way, features such as new ball shapes, obstacles or bonus objects can be added to the project very quickly.

### Level Editor Tool

I developed a Level editor tool for the game designer or level designer to work more easily in the project and to increase the speed of level design.

**What we can do with this editor tool:**

- Create a level
- Delete level
- Changing the total number of complated levels (Current Level)
- Determine how many stages the levels will have
- Determining targetBallCount and spawnedBallCount for each stage
- Determining the length of each stage
- Determining the platform color of each stag

**Usage of Level Editor Tool:**
